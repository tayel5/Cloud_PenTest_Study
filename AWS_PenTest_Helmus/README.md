This folder will contain my notes and work from following along with Jonathan Helmus's AWS Penetration Testing. By no means is this meant to be a replacement for the book, just my personal learning, notes, and work in relation to Helmus's book which I encourage anyone reading this to purchase and read for themselves at: https://www.packtpub.com/product/aws-penetration-testing/9781839216923
